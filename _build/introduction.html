<p>This website is an interactive <a href="https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html">Jupyter Book</a> aimed at basic statistical concepts encountered in physical sciences. 
It was developed originally for the lecture portion of an introductory physics lab course at NYU, and is in many ways meant
to complement, critique, and modernize the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Error-Analysis-Uncertainties-Measurements/dp/093570275X"><em>An Introduction to Error Analysis</em>, 2nd Ed. by John R. Taylor (Univ. Sci. Books, 1997).</a>, which is commonly used in many introductory physics courses.</p>
<p>The goals of this book are to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>refine understanding of the notion of “uncertainty” in scientific context.</p>
</li>
<li><p>develop critical quantitative reasoning abilities, including estimation,
approximation, and calculation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>develop basic understanding of Monte Carlo techniques</p>
</li>
<li><p>appreciate and anticipate how computers are evolving scientific practices</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This book makes heavy use of python and Jupyter, and is interactive.</p>
